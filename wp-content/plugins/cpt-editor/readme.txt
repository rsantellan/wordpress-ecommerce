Customize the text labels or menu names for any registered custom post type using a simple Dashboard user interface.

== Description ==

Customize the text labels or menu names for any registered custom post type using a simple Dashboard user interface. No PHP file editing is necessary!

* Want to rename `Posts` to `News`?
* Want to rename `Media` to `Files`?
* Want to rename the WooThemesâ€™ `Features` post type to `Tours`?

You can do all of this (and more) using this plugin.

For example, you could customize the following Custom Post Types:

* The `Posts` Custom Post Type (created by WordPress Core)
* The `Pages` Custom Post Type (created by WordPress Core)
* The `Media` Custom Post Type (created by WordPress Core)
* Any Custom Post Type that is created by a WordPress plugin
* Any Custom Post Type that is created by a WordPress theme

This means that you no longer have to modify PHP files in order to rename a Custom Post Type!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

It provides an easy way for you to modify/customise the *labels* of any registered Custom Post Type. This includes WordPress' built-in post types, as well as any Custom Post Types created by a plugin or theme.

= What doesn't this plugin do? =

It doesn't allow you do other things such as changing a Custom Post Type's rewrite slug or body class. Changing those can cause styling or display issues with themes.

If you look at [this WordPress Codex page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type#Arguments), the `labels` values can be changed by this plugin. All other parameters (such as `description`, `public`, `exclude_from_search`, etc.) ***cannot*** be customised using this plugin.

= Does this plugin modify any core WordPress, plugin or theme files? =

No. It uses WordPress' hook/filter to override Custom Post Type definitions on-the-fly. No files are modified by this plugin.

= Does this plugin permanently change anything? =

No. If you deactivate this plugin, your Custom Post Type definitions will revert to their defaults.

= Does this plugin work with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes - this plugin works with WordPress Multisite.
